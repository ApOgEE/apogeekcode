This branch is my java exercise code that I think might be useful for my future reference. 
I notice that I quickly forget my codes since I do code in many language. This is why I wanna start to
find and keep my exercise code for my reference or perhaps for others too.

I've lost lot of other codes I did before. I wanna start to keep it now.
