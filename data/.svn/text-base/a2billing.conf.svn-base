;	30 :  The timeout parameter is optional. If not specifed, the Dial command will wait indefinitely, exiting only when the originating channel hangs up, or all the dialed channels return a busy or error condition. Otherwise it specifies a maximum time, in seconds, that the Dial command is to wait for a channel to answer.
;	H: Allow the caller to hang up by dialing * 
;	r: Generate a ringing tone for the calling party
;	g: When the called party hangs up, exit to execute more commands in the current context. (new in 1.4)
;	i: Asterisk will ignore any forwarding (302 Redirect) requests received. Essential for DID usage to prevent fraud. (new in 1.4) Useful if you are ringing a group of people and one person has set their phone to forwarded direct to voicemail on their cell or something which normally prevents any of the other phones from ringing.
;	R: Indicate ringing to the calling party when the called party indicates ringing, pass no audio until answered.
;	m: Provide Music on Hold to the calling party until the called channel answers. 		
; 	L(x[:y][:z]): Limit the call to 'x' ms, warning when 'y' ms are left, repeated every 'z' ms)
;				  %timeout% tag is replaced by the calculated timeout according the credit & destination rate!
