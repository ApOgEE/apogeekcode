Purpose: 
I found that on a2billing 1.3.3, the agi-conf is in /etc/asterisk/a2billing.conf. However, since a2billing 1.6.0
which I tried to migrate, the agi-conf is in database. So, I made this script to copy the agi-conf (I have up to agi-conf10) 
from a2billing.conf to a2billing 1.7.1 database. Here is how to use the script.

1. Copy your /etc/asterisk/a2billing.conf from a2b 1.3.3 to 'data' directory.

2. Edit lib/dbconf.inc to match your database settings 

3. Run the script from command line:
     php proconf.php

4. Check your agi-conf is updated in your a2billing admin
